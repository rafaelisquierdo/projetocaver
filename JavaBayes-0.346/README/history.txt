JavaBayes history

Quick description of versions and updates (this file was 
created February 27 1997, so facts before this date are
not very accurately described):

- Jan 31 2001: JavaBayes 0.346
  A small error in the JohnMaryCall example was 
    fixed (a probability value was incorrectly typed as 0.94).
  A bug in the output (printing) routines, introduced
    in version 0.345, was detected by Alan Mehlenbacher 
    and Bozhena Bidyuk and was fixed (changes to
    ProbabilityFunction.java).
  A simple warning is now displayed to the user in the
    console everytime a probability measure is edited
    and does not add up to one (following suggestions
    by Robert Wilensky and Simon Keizer).
  
- Nov 24 2000: JavaBayes 0.345
  Changed color of arcs to gray; previous color was lightGray
    and made it hard to see in viewgraphs (in NetworkPanel.java).
  Corrected problem with rendering circles in Java2, thanks
    to a suggestion by Michael Becke (in NetworkPanel.java).
  Corrected problem with Help menu that could appear in certain
    implementation of Java, particularly in the Mac (solution
    given by Jason Townsend) (in JavaBayesInterfaceConsoleFrame.java).
  Changed presentation of probability functions to include
    names of values (suggested by Robert Wilensky) 
    (in ProbabilityFunction.java).
  Changed the default values of variables, to make it
    compatible with examples (suggested by Robert Wilensky) 
    (in InferenceGraphNode.java).
  Corrected problem with the quit dialog staying alive in
    web browsers (in QuitDialog.java).
  
- Sep 12 2000: JavaBayes 0.344.
  Removed the option "Sensitivity" from the menu, because
        this option is not implemented yet.
  Corrected bug in computation of area (NetworkPanel.java),
        detected by Alexander Churbanov.
	The insidious problem with modal dialogs was 
	solved thanks to Robert E. Bruce; the problem boiled down 
	to removing the "synchronized" from the show methods.
        Yet another bug in the Junction Tree algorithm was
	found by Wei Zhou and corrected; the system was 
	tested more carefully and now the junction tree
	algorithm seems (finally) correct.
	Observed nodes are now affected by changes immediately,
	not after random events in the network panel.
	Changed the starting mode to MOVE_MODE, to prevent
	nodes from being created inadventently.

- Fev 7 2000: JavaBayes0.343.
	Wei Zhou detected bug in Junction Tree algorithm and
	proposed correction. Resulting code is a bit less
	efficient than it could be; this should be corrected.

- Nov 8 1999: JavaBayes0.342.
	Files in the InterchangeFormat package are
	renamed and files in the QuasiBayesianNetworks package
	are renamed and moved to the (new) CredalSets package. 
	These changes were made to allow JavaBayes to run
	in the Macintosh operating system.
	The edit dialogs for Network, Variable and Function
	changed considerably in design and functionality.
	One of the most important changes is the fact that
	now the user does not need to press enter to apply
	the changes; there is a specific Apply button to do that.

- Nov 23 1998: JavaBayes0.341.
        The XMLBIF format is updated accordingly
	to discussions in the Interchange Format committee;
	several major bugs in the code for junction trees are
	fixed; the layout of Edit dialogs changes (gets insets;
	colors for the Edit Function dialogs).

- Ago 1998: JavaBayes 0.34, with new format option allows 
	JavaBayes to save networks in the BUGS format; 
	a new algorithm option produces inferences based 
	in junction trees; dialogs are not modal in order 
	to accommodate bugs in the JDK 1.1.6; menus and
	options are re-organized (options for Explanations
	are organized).

- Dec 8 1997: Some bugs are corrected; the code for opening
	files (parsing) and saving files was re-designed.
	Now JavaBayes can open and save files in several formats.
	The new format 0.2, based on XML, is released with
	JavaBayes 0.333.

- Sept 2 1997: After several minor updates and corrections,
	JavaBayes0.33 is released. This is another major
	release:
	- The graphical editor was rewritten from scratch
	so that it does not have limitations in the number
	of nodes and arcs; preparing for scrolling in JDK1.1.
	Colors were added to the editor; new editing windows
	were created.
	- The graphical editor now supports full 
	specification of local and global credal sets.
	- D-separation relations are used to process
	only the nodes that can affect the result.
	- Triangulation using minimum-weight heuristic is
	used to produce an ordering for the bucket elimination.
	- Several bugs in the way explanations were handled
	were caught and corrected.
	- A release for JDK1.1.2 was compiled separately
	from the release for JDK1.0.2.

- Feb 27 1997: A major update, JavaBayes0.3 contains a
	number of important changes:
	- The graphical editor interface was partially rewritten
	to allow more options and a less cluttered environment.
	- The inference engine was extended to handle expectations,
	maximum a posteriori probability and maximum a
	posteriori expectations.
	- Preliminary algorithms for local robustness analysis
	were added; previous algorithms for global
	robustness analysis were rewritten from scratch.

- Dec 23 1996: A minor update, JavaBayes 0.2b, incorporates 
	preliminary, beta support for global robustness analysis
	for epsilon-contaminated and constant density bounded families.

- Dec 10 1996: JavaBayes 0.2 is released, incorporating the
	JavaCC parser for the InterchangeFormat.

- Nov 12 1996: The version of JavaBayes built by Chao-Lin Liu (which
	was not distributed) is used to teach students at
	University of Michigan.

- Nov 7 1996: The first version of the JavaBayes parser, which 
	was completely coded by hand, was built, but not
	packaged into JavaBayes0.1.

- Nov 3 1996: The name JavaBayes is adopted, using suggestion
	by Chao-Lin Liu and Michael Wellman

- Nov 2 1996: Chao-Lin Liu contributes code that detects cycles.

- Oct 20 1996: First version of graphical user interface incorporated
	from Sreekanth Nagarajan and Bruce D'Ambrosio's system.

- Sep 4 1996: Web site is created and BayesianNetworks is announced.

- Aug 23 1996: The package BayesianNetworks is created by
	Fabio Cozman; BayesNet.java, Buckets.java and OrderedEvidence.java.
	Data was read in simple format from file; data was processed
	through the AssessBel application and AssessBelApplet applet.
